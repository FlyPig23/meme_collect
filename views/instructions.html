                <h2>Why Cultural Context Matters: Examples</h2>
                
                <div class="example-box">
                    <h3>Example 1: "Netflix and Chill" (US Culture)</h3>
                    <img src="/images/netflixchill.jpg" alt="Netflix and Chill meme" class="example-image">
                    <div class="explanation">
                        <p><strong>Cultural Context:</strong> In US culture, "Netflix and Chill" is a euphemism for romantic or sexual activity, not literally watching Netflix.</p>
                        <p><strong>Potential Misunderstanding:</strong> Non-US people might interpret this literally as an invitation to watch movies together, leading to awkward situations. For example, an international student might innocently use this meme to invite friends over for movie watching, unaware of its implied meaning in US culture.</p>
                    </div>
                </div>

                <div class="example-box">
                    <h3>Example 2: "Green Hat" (Chinese Culture)</h3>
                    <img src="/images/greenhat.jpg" alt="Green hat meme" class="example-image">
                    <div class="explanation">
                        <p><strong>Cultural Context:</strong> In Chinese culture, wearing a green hat (Êà¥ÁªøÂ∏ΩÂ≠ê) is a symbol of infidelity, specifically indicating that someone's spouse has been unfaithful.</p>
                        <p><strong>Potential Misunderstanding:</strong> People from other cultures might innocently share images of green hats or gift them to Chinese friends, unaware that this could be interpreted as highly offensive or as making implications about someone's relationship.</p>
