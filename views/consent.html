                <p>We invite you to participate in a research study being conducted by investigators from Texas A&M University. 
                    You are being asked to participate in this research study because you
                    can contribute to our understanding of cross-cultural meme interpretation.</p>
                
                <h2>Purpose of the Study</h2>
                <p>The aim of this research is to explore how memes are interpreted differently across cultures
                    and to build a dataset that can help understand cultural misunderstandings in online communication.</p>
                
                <h2>Study Procedures</h2>
                <p>If you agree to participate, you will:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Complete a brief demographic survey</li>
                    <li>Upload at least 10 memes that you're familiar with</li>
                    <li>Provide detailed "Cultural Context" explanations for each meme, and "Potential Misunderstandings"</li>
                    <li>Label each meme with:
                        <ul>
                            <li>A sentiment label (choose one: positive, negative, or neutral)</li>
                            <li>Emotion labels (can select multiple: sarcastic, humorous, motivation, offensive)</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                </ul>
                
                <h2>Data Usage</h2>
                <p>We would like to use the data we obtain in this study for current research as well as future studies.
                    These studies may provide additional information that will be helpful in understanding cross-cultural
                    communication and developing better tools for cultural exchange online.</p>
                
                <h2>Confidentiality</h2>
                <p>Your data will be stored without any personally identifiable information. The memes and explanations
                    you provide will be used for research purposes only and will be stored securely.</p>
                
                <h2>Risks and Benefits</h2>
                <p>There are no known risks from being in this study. While you will not benefit personally,
                    your contributions will help improve cross-cultural understanding in online spaces.</p>
                
                <h2>Contact Information</h2>
